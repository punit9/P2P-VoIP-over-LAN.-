# P2P-VoIP-over-LAN
P2P VoIP over LAN without using central server.(Client-server application in Qt)

In many Big Organizations and companies, an intercom communication method is used for communicating in the same Organization.
This method costs much since it requires installing intercom cable, and also provides seperate telephone devices to employees.

This application uses microphone/speakers of laptop or mobile devices for communication using Local Area Network(LAN)/WLAN without using Internet Connection.
Since this application uses no central server, it provides Peer-to-Peer connectivity between devices for faster communication.
Improvements/Feature Suggestions are always welcome.
